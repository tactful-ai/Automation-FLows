# Form Step Automation-SDK Extension
Formstep revolutionizes user input and validation in the automation-sdk, eliminating code duplication and streamlining input handling. It centralizes logic, allowing custom validation rules and improving code reusability and organization. This enhancement results in a more efficient and user-friendly experience for developers.

# Documentation
1. Problem Statement
Handling user input and validation within the automation-sdk posed challenges, as it required developers to create multiple userInput functions for different questions and entries. This approach was time-consuming, lacked a unified methodology, and resulted in code duplication.

# 2. Solution Overview
To address the problem of handling user input and validation in the automation-sdk, a streamlined solution was developed. The key component of this solution is the introduction of a new function called formstep. This function serves as a centralized and efficient means of collecting user input with validation, eliminating the need for multiple userInput functions.

# 2.1 formstep Function
Objective: Create a custom function to simplify user input and validation.

Workflow:

formstep accepts a question as input and waits for the user's response.

The user's response is subjected to predefined validation rules or criteria.

If the user's input meets the validation criteria, the process proceeds; otherwise, the user is prompted to re-enter the information.

# 2.2 Centralized Approach
Benefits:

formstep centralizes user input and validation logic.

Developers no longer need to create numerous userInput functions for different questions and inputs.

This approach enhances code organization, code readability and maintainability.

# 2.3 Custom Validation Rules
Flexibility:

Developers can define custom validation rules tailored to each question's requirements.

For instance, if a question necessitates a numerical response, validation can verify the input as a valid number.

# 2.4 Reusable Form
Reusability:

formstep is designed for reuse across the project, accommodating various types of user input.

This promotes code reusability and consistency in user interactions.

# 2.5 Enhanced Efficiency
Development Time Savings:

The solution significantly reduces development effort and time by streamlining user input processes.

Developers can rapidly construct forms for user input, facilitating the addition and modification of questions in the future.

# 2.6 Improved User Experience
Standardized Interface:

Users benefit from a standardized and user-friendly input interface.

Validation ensures that entered data aligns with required criteria, reducing errors and improving overall user satisfaction.

# 3. Implementation Details
3.1 formstep Function Implementation
formstep was developed as a custom function within the automation-sdk.

It utilizes a well-defined process for collecting and validating user input.

Validation rules are modular and can be customized to suit specific question requirements.

# 3.2 Centralized User Input Management
All user input and validation logic is centralized within the formstep function.

Developers are encouraged to use formstep consistently throughout the project, minimizing redundant code.

# 3.3 Developer Guidelines
Documentation and guidelines on implementing formstep effectively are provided to developers.

Examples and best practices are outlined to ensure smooth adoption of this streamlined approach.

This documentation outlines the comprehensive solution for enhancing user input handling within the automation-sdk. The introduction of the formstep function, coupled with a centralized approach and custom validation rules, offers efficiency gains, code reusability, and an improved user experience. By adopting this solution, development teams can streamline their workflows and ensure a standardized, error-resistant user input process.
